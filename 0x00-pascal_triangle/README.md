The pascals triangle in python
where i represents the current row number and j represents the current column number.

We start each row with the number 1, as the first and last numbers in each row of Pascal's triangle are always 1. Then, we calculate the middle numbers using the formula mentioned inside the function. Finally, we add the last number 1 to complete the row.

By repeating this process for each row, we gradually build the entire Pascal's triangle. The result is a list of lists, where each sublist represents a row of the triangle.

Pascal's triangle has numerous interesting properties and applications in mathematics, combinatorics, and number theory. It is used to solve various mathematical problems and can also be found in nature, art, and computer graphics.

In Python, generating Pascal's triangle is a fascinating and educational exercise that demonstrates the power of algorithms and the beauty of patterns in mathematics.
